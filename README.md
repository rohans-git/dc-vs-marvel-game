# Project-1-DC-VS-MARVEL-game


First Ironhack project, a game using canvas HTML 


## Concept of the game

The user has to protect/dodge themself from the DC/Marvel characters that are coming from above. They can collect zaps to recover or win points and shoot the other characters.

## Components of the Game

There are obstacles and zaps to shoot them. On the bottom there is a player. A score bar with the level of points.

// What are the actions of the player --- 

Move left (left arrow), move right (right arrow), shoot up (space bar) and P to pause the game

// How do you earn points ---

Shooting directly to the sheilds you protect your immunity. It takes one shoot to destroy the sheild. Each sheild kill makes the player's immunity grows. 

// When do you win/lose --- 

If the player gets hit by 4 sheild, the player goes to danger zone. If the player gets hit for a 5th time, the player dies.
